=============
* Watson-Crick complementarity
    * Adenine only matches to Thymine (A-T)
    * Guanine only matches to Cytosine (G-C)
* **Basic techniques to compute with DNA**
    * denaturate
    * anneal
    * separate
    * select
    * multiply
* Adleman's algorithm for solving directed Hamiltonian path problem - the potential of the method lies **in massively parallel searches**
    * Idea: **DNA-Map-Reduce**
* Lipton - Satisfiability problem - **NP-complete**
* Type of the problem's investigated by Adleman and Lipton: **combinatorial search**
* Rothemund - DNA Turing machines
* Roweis - DNA as addressable memory
* Paul's personal interest: **Cryptanalysis on DNA-computers**
